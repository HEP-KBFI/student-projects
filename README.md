[Here](https://github.com/HEP-KBFI/student-projects/issues) you can find small, hands-on student projects to work on, related to the topics in our lab.

The projects should be self-contained within a jupyter notebook that can be run directly on a laptop with minimal dependencies.

Ideally, the projects should be completable withing a few weeks of work, and result in a plot or visualization that can be included in an ongoing paper.
